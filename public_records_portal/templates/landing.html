	  <h1>Welcome to NYC Government’s home for filing Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests.</h1>
	  <p>On this site you can file a records request with every agency of the City of New York.  Some government information is already available to the public and doesn’t require a FOIL request.  Examples of public information include copies of your own birth certificate and reports issued by City agencies.</p>
	  <p>The site you see today is the beginning of a new approach to making records easily available.  In the coming months, we will be adding new features such as tracking the status of a FOIL request and expanding the search function.</p>
