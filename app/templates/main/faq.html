        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-1">What does FOIL mean?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-1">FOIL stands for the Freedom of Information Law. The New York State Freedom of Information Law
            requires government agencies to provide records to the public upon request. Government records
            affect the lives of each New Yorker, and providing easy access to the records makes government work
            better.</p>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-2">What kinds of records do I have the right to see?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-2">The FOIL definition of records is very broad and includes information found in paper and electronic
            documents and audio and visual recordings. All records are available upon request, unless an
            exception in FOIL permits an agency to deny access to a record.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-3">Are there any public records that I can’t see?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-3">Yes, there are exceptions in FOIL. Most of the exceptions are based upon common sense and the
            potential for harm that would arise if the contents of the record were disclosed to unauthorized
            people. If disclosure of a record would be damaging to an individual or prevent a government agency
            from carrying out its duties, it is likely that some or all of the record may be withheld. You can
            read the law, including the exceptions, by clicking here. <a

        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-4">Do I have to explain why I want the records?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-4">No, unless you are a business or other organization that is requesting a list of names and
            addresses.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-5">How much does it cost to get access to government records?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-5">There is no charge to submit a FOIL request or to look at
            records in the office of an agency.
            However, you may be charged by an agency for the cost of reproducing the records you requested. FOIL
            limits the amount that can be charged. You may always include in your request letter a specific statement
            limiting the amount that you are
            willing to pay. If an agency estimates that the total cost will exceed that amount, you may narrow
            your request in order to reduce the cost.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-6">How long does it take to get access to government records?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-6">The agency will acknowledge your request within five (5) business days of receiving it. The actual
            time to complete a request will vary depending on many factors, such as the number of records
            requested and the difficulty involved in locating and reviewing the records. You will be notified of
            the amount of time the agency needs to complete your request.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-7">Can I make an anonymous request?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-7">On the OpenRecords portal, your name will not be viewable by the public. The topic of the request
            will be shown.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-8">How do I know which agency handles the records I need?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-8">The OpenRecords portal has a field named “categories” that will help you identify the correct agency.
            When you choose one of the categories, the list of possible agencies will be narrowed to those that
            may have the records you want. You can select the agency from the list provided to start the FOIL
            request process. If you submit a records request to the wrong agency, you will be notified within
            five days that the request should be resubmitted to a different agency.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-9">How do I make a request?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-9">You can submit a FOIL request at the OpenRecords portal for all NYC agencies. Visit <a
                href="{{ url_for('request.new') }}">{{ request.url_root }}request/new</a> and follow
            the prompts and directions provided in order to make your request.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-10">I asked for a copy of public records and the agency refused my request, saying that
            it was too broad. What can I do?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-10">An agency may deny a request that does not "reasonably describe" records. If the request is too
            vague, the agency may ask for clarification. You may then submit a new request with a more specific
            description of the records you would like.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-11">How do I track a request?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-11">After your request has been submitted, a message will display verifying the submission and providing
            a request number. Select Search Requests from the top menu and enter your request number,
            then press the Search button. The status of your request will be displayed.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-12">What if I have multiple requests that I want to track or would like to see what other
            requests have been submitted?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-12">Select View Requests from the top menu. You can then search existing requests using text from the
            request, the current status, the date range and the agency.</p>
        <a class="back-to-top" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>Back to top</a>
        <br><br>

        <h2 class="faq-question" id="faq-13">What if I don’t agree with an agency’s response?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer" tabindex="0" id="faq-answer-13">You may appeal a decision to deny your request within 30 days of receiving the denial or partial
            denial. The denial or partial denial should provide the contact information for the Agency Appeals
            Officer. Your appeal letter should state the reason you are appealing and why the agency's response
            to the request was improper.</p>
