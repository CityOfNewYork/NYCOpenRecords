            <p>
                OpenRecords is a quick, simple way for individuals to submit Freedom of
                Information Law (FOIL) requests to a NYC agency. The web application also
                allows government employees to manage, respond to, and fulfill incoming requests.
                By providing more information about records requests, members of the public may
                find what they need without having to create a new public record request.

            <p>
                City agencies will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy.
                City agencies will not make records available that have been exempted from disclosure by Federal,
                State, or Local statute, including records that would impair contract awards or collective bargaining
                negotiations, are trade secrets, or are compiled for law enforcement purposes and if disclosed would
                interfere with investigations or judicial proceedings, deprive a person to a fair trial, identify a
                confidential source, reveal investigative techniques, or endanger a person's life. Records
                such as reports and data will be posted to the portal 20 business days after they are sent
                directly to the requester.

                History of OpenRecords
            </h2>
            <p>
                In 2014, the Department of Records and Information Services and the Department of Information Technology
                and Telecommunications began working with open source code developed by Code for America to build a
                portal for Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests. The resulting FOIL portal allows members of the
                public to easily submit a request for government records to City agencies and offices. Agency users can
                use automated scripts to respond and to provide information about the timeframe to fulfill requests and
                to post the responsive record on the portal unless it contains personal privacy information. As of March
                2024, there are 55 New York City agencies and offices using the OpenRecords portal.
