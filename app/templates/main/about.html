                What is OpenRECORDS?
            </h4>
            <p>
                OpenRECORDS is a quick, simple way for individuals to submit Freedom of
                Information Law (FOIL) requests to a NYC agency. The web application also
                allows government employees to manage, respond to, and fulfill incoming requests.
                By providing more information about records requests, members of the public may
                find what they need without having to create a new public record request.

                Why aren't all documents uploaded on OpenRECORDS?
            </h4>
            <p>
                City agencies will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy.
                City agencies will not make records available that have been exempted from disclosure by Federal,
                State, or Local statute, including records that would impair contract awards or collective bargaining
                negotiations, are trade secrets, or are compiled for law enforcement purposes and if disclosed would
                interfere with investigations or judicial proceedings, deprive a person to a fair trial, identify a
                confidential source, reveal investigative techniques, or endanger a person's life. Records
                such as reports and data will be posted to the portal 20 business days after they are sent
                directly to the requester. Records that contain email correspondence from government employees
                will be sent directly to the requester.

                History of OpenRECORDS (Previously RecordTrac)
            </h4>
            <p>
                The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac for the City of Oakland in response to public
                complaints that people did not know what happened after submitting FOIL requests and that the response
                time was too long. By making the process transparent, requesters could know when their requests were
                fulfilled.
                In 2014, the Department of Records and Information Services and the Department of Information Technology
                and Telecommunications began working with the open source code from the Oakland application to create
                additional features and functionality required to meet the FOIL needs of New York City agencies. The
                resulting FOIL portal, is part of the Mayorâ€™s overall initiative for transparency in government. The
                initial beta version of OpenRecords was released in March 2015 for use with eight pilot agencies.. The
                current version 2.0 was released in January 2017 and is used by 21 agencies, with more to be added on a
                regular basis. The DORIS development team rewrote all of the code to increase the stability and
                robustness of the application.
