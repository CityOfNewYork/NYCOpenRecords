        <p>
            OpenRECORDS is a quick, simple way for individuals to submit Freedom of
            Information Law (FOIL) requests to a NYC agency. The web application also
            allows government employees to manage, respond to, and fulfill incoming requests.
            By providing more information about records requests, members of the public may
            find what they need without having to create a new public record request.
        </p>

        <p>
            City agencies will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy.
            City agencies will not make records available that have been exempted from disclosure by Federal,
            State, or Local statute, including records that would impair contract awards or collective bargaining
            negotiations, are trade secrets, or are compiled for law enforcement purposes and if disclosed would
            interfere with investigations or judicial proceedings, deprive a person to a fair trial, identify a
            confidential source, reveal investigative techniques, or endanger a person's life. Records
            such as reports and data will be posted to the portal 20 business days after they are sent
            directly to the requester. Records that contain email correspondence from government employees
            will be sent directly to the requester.

        <p>
            The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac with the City of Oakland in response to public
            complaints that they didnâ€™t understand what happened after they submitted their requests and
            it took too long to get the records they needed. By making everything completely transparent,
            you can know your request is fulfilled.
