    <h1 id="about">About OpenRECORDS</h1>

    <p class="lead">OpenRECORDS is a quick, simple way for you to submit a public records request to a New York City
        Agency.</p>

    <p><strong>Most information on this site is public.</strong> Your contact information, and most personal information
        that may
        be contained in government documents will not be made available to the public.</p>

    <h4 id="what"> What is OpenRECORDS?</h4>

    <p>OpenRECORDS is a quick, simple way for individuals to submit Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests to a NYC
        agency. The web application also allows government employees to manage, respond to, and fulfill incoming
        requests. By providing more information about records requests, members of the public may find what they need
        without having to create a new public record request.</p>


    <h4 id="documents">Why aren't all documents uploaded on OpenRECORDS?</h4>

    <p>City agencies will not publicly release records or information that violates your right to privacy. City agencies
        will
        not make records available that have been exempted from disclosure by Federal, State, or Local statute,
        including
        records that would impair contract awards or collective bargaining negotiations, are trade secrets, or are
        compiled for
        law enforcement purposes and if disclosed would interfere with investigations or judicial proceedings, deprive a
        person
        to a fair trial, identify a confidential source, reveal investigative techniques, or endanger a person's life.
        Records
        such as reports and data will be posted to the portal 20 business days after they are sent directly to the
        requester.
        Records that contain email correspondence from government employees will be sent directly to the requester.</p>



    <h4 id="why">History of OpenRECORDS (Previously RecordTrac)</h4>


    <p>The 2013 Code for America fellows created RecordTrac with the City of Oakland in response to public complaints
        that they
        didnâ€™t understand what happened after they submitted their requests and it took too long to get the records they
        needed.
        By making everything completely transparent, you can know your request is fulfilled.</p>
